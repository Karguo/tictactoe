# tictactoe
Tic Tac Toe game for Project 1

Tried many, many different ways in dealing with the game logic. Attempted to use arrays and calling objects but was not working as intended. 
Working files directory is just one example of just my previous working js files. 
Also tried to work using just div's for grid but could not get it to work properly and decided to use a table instead. 

Got most of the game logic to work, at last. 
Working - toggling between X and O, 
prevent another click from changing a box that has been clicked already, 
show a message saying whose turn it is and show a message saying who won, 
randomise who starts and of course, 
showing the winning scenarios/combinations. 

Decided to approach this every step-by-step of what is needed and create the necessary functions to achieving. 

What I like: managed to animate my css/header to look like it has been typed.
put a "wanted" poster on top of the "oak" background

Unresolved Issues:
How to show tie game,
How to reset/replay game - not using the reload function
more CSS elements, intended to do more western-cowboy theme ala Wynonna Earp.

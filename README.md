# tictactoe
Tic Tac Toe game for Project 1

Tried many, many different ways in dealing with the game logic. Working files directory is just one example of just my previous working js files. Also tried to work using just div's for grid but could not get it to work properly and decided to use a table instead. 

Got most of the game logic to work, at last. 
Working - toggling between X and O, prevent another click from changing a box that has been clicked already, show a message saying whose turn it is and show a message saying who won, randomise who starts and of course, showing the winning scenarios/combinations. 

Unresolved Issues:
How to show tie game
How to reset/replay game
more CSS elements, intended to do more western-cowboy theme ala Wynonna Earp.
CSS not working!

// create a 9-box grid (css ? flex-box) -> do it in 9 individual boxes OR just one whole grid (can that be done??) ==> COMPLETED using flex-box
// create "X"s and "O"s -> onclick
// 2 players taking turns each -> how? create 2 separate functions? but then would need to link them back together?
// OR print "X" on first click, "O" on 2nd click and alternate? - display that it is player 1 or 2's turn clearly
// create the winning scenarios -> win in a straight row OR win in a diagonal row

// Find pattern:
// create ONE box which can have "X" or "O" onclick, BUT cannot be clicked again or changed on another click
// repeat pattern x 8 more times to create the board of 3x3 grid
